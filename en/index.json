	"content": " The Tang Primer at a Glance Tang Primer uses Anlogic\u0026rsquo;s EG4S20 as the core unit, 20K logic unit (LUT4/LUT5 hybrid architecture), approximately 130KB SRAM, built-in 32bit bit width 64MBit SDRAM, rich LVDS pin, built-in 12-bit 1MSPS ADC This provides unlimited possibilities for Tang Primer:\nTang Primer features  FPC40P socket, can be connected to RGB LCD, VGA adapter board, high speed DAC module. FPC24P socket, can be connected to DVP camera, high speed ADC module. Resistive touch screen controller for I2C interface, used with RGB LCD. 3-channel DCDC power supply chip, stable and efficient power supply, independent adjustment of Bank0 IO level. FPGA configuration Flash, 8Mbit User Flash, nor/nand optional. Onboard FPGA JTAG Download Debugger. Onboard RGB LED The adjacent pins LVDS are drawn in the same length, and 8 GCLKs are taken out, and 8 ADCs are all taken out. The double row pin spacing is 900 mils and is compatible with breadboard development. The half hole leads to an additional 40 IO and the entire board leads to 130+ IO.  Pinouts Pinout for New Tang Primer Board.\nPinout for Old Tang Primer Board.\nResources Attachments:  EG4S20_DataSheet_V1.5_english.pdf\n Eagle_DataSheet_V2.8_english.pdf\n LicheeTang+RV.pdf\n sipeed-tang-primer-pins.pdf\n  "
