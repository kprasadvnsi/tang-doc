Thanks to the simplicity of Tang Dynasty FPGA development environment, Tang Primer needs very few things to get started.

## Getting the Tang Dinasty IDE

Just download the latest version of Tang Dynasty IDE for your OS (Windows, Linux) from [here](http://dl.sipeed.com/TANG/Primer/IDE): itâ€™s that simple.

The download may be slow, so be patient...

You can also find the latest version on anlogic website [here](http://www.anlogic.com/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=11&Id=171&FId=t3:11:3).

## Getting Example Code

Tang Primer comes with a lot of examples. They can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Lichee-Pi/Tang_FPGA_Examples).
